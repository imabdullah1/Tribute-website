						<h2>Founder of Pakistan</h2>
						<p>
							Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a
							barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his return to
							India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest
							in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal
							practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National
							Congress in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these
							early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu-Muslim
							unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress
							and the All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become
							prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule
							League, and proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan
							to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
							subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress
							when it agreed to follow a campaign of satyagraha, which he
							regarded as political anarchy.
